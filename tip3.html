            Many devices, such as televisions, computers, and chargers, still consume power even when turned off. This is known as "phantom" or "standby" power. By unplugging devices when they are not in use, you can reduce this unnecessary energy consumption.

            Alternatively, using power strips with switches allows you to easily disconnect multiple devices at once, saving time and energy.
